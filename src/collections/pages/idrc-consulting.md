      We strongly believe in one-size-fits-one solutions, and this extends to our services. We work closely with our clients to co-create customized approaches that can include a combination of training, accessibility evaluation, and flexible consulting support. 

      There is no fixed, linear path through this work; organizations that feel behind can make great leaps through sustainable initiatives. Our consulting ethos is that everyone can (and should) learn to fold the perspective shift that Inclusive Design gives us into everything we do professionally: designing and developing products, working in teams, procurement processes, HR practices, management, hiring, external outreach… everything. 

      Clients we have worked with include: **The Canadian Digital Service, IKEA, Lululemon, RBC Ventures, Bell, Telus, Scotiabank, Greater Toronto Airports Authority, CIBC, City of Toronto, Sidewalk Labs, Ontario Cannabis Store, National Geographic, and others.**

      ### **_We want to help you achieve your inclusion and accessibility goals._**

      ## Training

      Inclusion and accessibility are a team effort spanning from ideation to practical skills, to culture. We offer a wide range of training approaches and workshops to take your team to the next level, whether you’re looking to change minds, learn practical skills, or inspire teams.

      Along with training workshops, we can provide experiential and hands-on learning activities such as inclusive design sprints and inclusive design challenges. When creating or customizing content, IDRC can co-create trainings with the client (to their desired level of engagement).

      Training may include but is not limited to the following topics:

      **Inclusive Design Thinking&#32;**

      - What is accessibility? What is inclusion? How are they related to innovation?
      - Definitions of equity, inclusion, and diversity (DEI, EDI, BEDI, etc.) demystified.
      - Developing an inclusive culture; building capacity.
      - Innovation, change and the perspective shift that is inclusive thinking.

      **Applied Accessibility Training**

      - Understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
      - Accessible design patterns and annotation
      - Approaches to UI/Web accessibility evaluation
      - Accessible Graphic Design
      - Physical Space Accessibility

      ### **_Build custom training from our list of topics or start with a prepared workshop that bundles related topics._**

      ## Accessibility Assessments

      We offer accessibility reviews and audits at every stage of the design process. Grounded in our expertise in inclusive design and digital accessibility and in-depth knowledge of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we combine extensive manual, assistive technology and automated testing to evaluate websites, mobile apps, and other digital interactions. Based on our findings, we provide the guidance and recommendations you need to create accessible experiences and make your products inclusive to a broader audience. We can review designs, existing websites or apps, and provide documentation such as VPATs, accessibility statements or other accessibility communication
