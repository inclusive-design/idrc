title: Framework for Accessible and Equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
  Education
description: >-
  This is a practical guide to the dizzying domain of artificial intelligence
  within the education ecosystem, with a particular focus on the impact on
  equity and accessibility. AI and accessibility are beginning to have an
  interesting conversation. Not unlike the conversation about AI in general, the
  conversation about AI and accessibility in education can be found taking a
  techno-solutionist or techno-tragedist perspective. As we grow wary of this
  false dichotomy, we move toward what is much more likely to be the case: that
  it will be “both/and” and “neither/nor.” AI can make things better. It can
  benefit us all, it can address inequities, and it can lower barriers for
  people with disabilities in education. It can equally be used to amplify
  inequities (intentional and unintended), including discrimination against
  people who do not fit a “norm.”
