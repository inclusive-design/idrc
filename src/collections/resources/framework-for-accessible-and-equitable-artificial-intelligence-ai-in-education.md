title: Framework for Accessible and Equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
  Education
description: >-
  This work is an aggregation of work being done in the Artificial Intelligence,
  Education, and Accessibility communities. It reflects the work and influence
  of many diverse voices and perspectives.


  This is a practical guide to the dizzying domain of artificial intelligence within the education ecosystem, with a particular focus on the impact on equity and accessibility. AI and accessibility are beginning to have an interesting conversation. Not unlike the conversation about AI in general, the conversation about AI and accessibility in education can be found taking a techno-solutionist or techno-tragedist perspective. As we grow wary of this false dichotomy, we move toward what is much more likely to be the case: that it will be “both/and” and “neither/nor.” AI can make things better. It can benefit us all, it can address inequities, and it can lower barriers for people with disabilities in education. It can equally be used to amplify inequities (intentional and unintended), including discrimination against people who do not fit a “norm.”


  The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily align with the views of the Government of Ontario or the Ontario Online Learning Consortium.


  The following framework was written in early 2024. It is meant to be the start of a conversation that continues with your contributions. What is presented here will not keep up with the field of AI in Education. By the moment it is uploaded into a repository, the domain will have already changed. This is the burden we, as content producers, have to address in this brave new world of AI. 


  How might AIs use the following content, we wonder. We remain hopeful they will propagate the approaches and warning and benefits, but we are troubled knowing some have already been trained to treat hostile those things that address diversity, equity, and inclusion.


  And a reminder that with AI, what is the ‘best’ today might not be tomorrow…
