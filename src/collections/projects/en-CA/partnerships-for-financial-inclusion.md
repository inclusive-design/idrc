## Building Inclusive Financial Systems for All Canadians

From research to action: advancing financial inclusion through community-led innovation.

* [Join the Movement (FIRM)](https://forms.office.com/r/ch9EFgk34e)

## Why Financial Inclusion Matters

Nearly **1 million Canadians are unbanked** and **5 million are underbanked**—not by choice, but due to systemic barriers. People with disabilities, newcomers, racialized communities, and those without stable housing face the greatest challenges.

Financial exclusion is not a fringe issue. It limits access to basic tools for stability and participation in society. Inclusive financial systems are about **dignity, opportunity, and justice**.

## Mission

The mission of this multi-phase project is to:

* Empower the disability and Deaf communities take action in removing barriers and advocating for more inclusive financial systems
* Guide policy makers, governments, and large organizations in creating more inclusive financial systems that are accessible and equitable
* Support security and privacy organizations to address fraud, scams, and abuse faced by the disability and Deaf community
* Advance systemic change through Phase 2 and FIRM:a community-led infrastructure that strengthens grassroots capacity, fosters institutional collaboration, and ensures sustainability beyond federal funding
* Build long-term resilience by establishing shared services, knowledge hubs, and governance structures that enable inclusive financial innovation

Phase 1 laid the foundation with research, tools and partnerships.

Phase 2 focuses on scaling these efforts through FIRM, creating a sustainable ecosystem that will support transformation of financial systems for all Canadians. 

## Phase 1 Achievements

Over the past three years, the Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) partnered with community-led organizations and major financial institutions to identify barriers and co-create solutions. Key outputs include:

* **Guidebook for Financial Inclusion**  
  A bilingual, accessible resource for financial institutions, featuring practical frameworks, narratives, and activities to design inclusive services.  
  [Access the Guidebook](https://financial-inclusion.inclusivedesign.ca/)
* **White Paper: Financial Partnerships as a Pathway to Financial Inclusion**  
  A strategic roadmap for systemic change, introducing the Financial Inclusion and Resilience Movement (FIRM).

* **Knowledge Repository**  
  An open-access collection of tools, research, and resources to support inclusive financial ecosystems.

## What’s Next: Phase 2 and FIRM

We are launching **Phase 2** to scale and sustain impact through the **Financial Inclusion and Resilience Movement (FIRM)**—a community-led infrastructure designed to strengthen grassroots capacity and foster institutional collaboration.

**FIRM includes four core components:**

* **Digital Shared Services Hub**  
  Operational support for grassroots organizations (legal, bookkeeping, fundraising, IT).
* **Online Knowledge Hub**  
  A platform for co-design, research, and accessibility consulting.
* **Community-led Governance**  
  Decision-making grounded in lived experience.
* **Community of Practice (CoP)**  
  A national network for peer learning and collaboration.
