## About the Financial Inclusion Project

The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) at OCAD University is working on a project that aims to make financial systems more inclusive to people with disabilities (PWD) and Deaf people in Canada.

### What do we mean when we say "financial systems"?

Financial systems include any systems related to money and finances.

They include institutions like:

- Banks and credit unions
- Insurance companies
- Canada Revenue Agency

Financial systems affect your everyday interactions with money, like:

- Making payments and transferring money
- Managing your finances and planning for the future
- Managing your credit score
- Getting a loan or paying off debt
- Dealing with a tax audit
- Trying to qualify for an assistance program
- Proving you are who you say you are when you make a transaction

### What do we mean when we say "disability"?

A disability is not a medical issue or an impairment to be fixed. A disability comes up when the way something works creates a barrier for someone because of their physical, mental health, developmental, or sensory traits. These barriers prevent a person’s full and equal participation in society.

## Project goal

- Understand the barriers for people with disabilities and Deaf people in interacting with financial systems
- Understand the risks for people with disabilities and Deaf people in financial systems, and the ways they may be vulnerable to fraud and financial abuse
- Learn about things that have been done in the past that make the financial systems more inclusive
- Explore promising ways to make up-and-coming financial systems more inclusive
- Share any knowledge we gain with the broader disability and Deaf communities, through both online and in-person networks.

### Outcomes

At the end of October 2024, this project expects to:
Publish a report about financial inclusion in Canada and its barriers, vulnerabilities, and approaches for people with disabilities and Deaf people.
Outline a plan for sustaining ongoing community engagement, advocacy, and education on issues related to financial inclusion.

### Mission

The mission of this project is to:

- Help the disability and Deaf communities take action to remove barriers and advocate for more inclusive financial systems
- Guide policy makers, governments, and large organizations in making more inclusive financial systems and removing current barriers
- Guide security and privacy organizations to tackle fraud, scams, and abuse faced by the disability and Deaf community
