May 27 - 28, 2024
_Monday & Tuesday_

**Montreal, Quebec, Canada**
1450 Guy Street

**Welcome to Accessible Canada — Accessible World**, a conference that aims to advance accessibility and inclusive design in various domains. We live in a world where accessibility barriers are diverse and complex, and new ones are emerging at an exponential rate. 

- Who and what are we missing? What are the accessibility gaps or barriers missed?
- Inclusive decision-making
- Innovation in standards and policy  
- Accessible and equitable communications

To answer these questions, we need to build an expansive community of practice that encompasses the full range of experiences of disability and other areas of expertise needed to realize accessibility goals. This conference is an opportunity to co-create resources and to share knowledge and lessons learned in advancing accessibility and inclusion. We invite you to join us in this collaborative effort, and to ensure that the global accessibility agenda is guided by people with disabilities. Together, we can make Canada and the world more accessible and inclusive for everyone.

## Conference Format

There are no formal presentations during the conference. The Conference is a flipped model where [presentations are available online](https://acaw-cama.idrc.ocadu.ca/en/) ahead of time so attendees can view the ones that interest them, at their own pace, when it is convenient for them. Viewing content ahead of the conference is optional for conference participants, and participants can watch as many or as few videos as they would like. [Start viewing now on our submissions site](https://acaw-cama.idrc.ocadu.ca/en/). The conference has four parallel streams:

**Theme 1: Who and what are we missing?**

**Theme 2: How do we support inclusive decision-making?**

**Theme 3: How can we develop accessibility standards that are responsive, inclusive and effective?**

**Theme 4: How can we promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in media production, representation, and consumption?**

During the conference, a facilitator and provocateur will provide an overview of the field and provoke discussion enabling attendees to participate actively in the discussions.
