This is a practical guide to the dizzying domain of artificial intelligence within the education ecosystem, with a particular focus on the impact on equity and accessibility. AI and accessibility are beginning to have an interesting conversation. Not unlike the conversation about AI in general, the conversation about AI and accessibility in education can be found taking a techno-solutionist or techno-tragedist perspective. As we grow wary of this false dichotomy, we move toward what is much more likely to be the case: that it will be “both/and” and “neither/nor.” AI can make things better. It can benefit us all, it can address inequities, and it can lower barriers for people with disabilities in education. It can equally be used to amplify inequities (intentional and unintended), including discrimination against people who do not fit a “norm.”
