description: Data Communities for Inclusion is a network of researchers, designers, and community organizers who are advocating for cooperatively-owned approaches to governing Artificial Intelligence and data technologies. Funded by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), the DCI project is creating a toolkit of open-access data infrastructure tools, inclusive design resources, case studies, and governance practices that are motivated by the successful work of the Self-Employed Womenâ€™s Association and other grassroots communities.
