## A﻿bout the project

Regulating the Digital Domain (RtDD) is looking at the challenges people with disabilities face when interacting with ICT\* (information and communication technologies) and digital tools\**. 

During the project the RtDD team will:

* work to uncover what causes barriers, 
* focus on whole systems (not just a localized issue), 
* identify ways to stop barriers or prevent barriers from becoming worse 

The RtDD goal is to improve digital inclusion and ICT accessibility for the full range of PWD (people with disabilities). To make improvements the project will address the design of a regulatory system focused on regulating the digital domain. The project findings will inform Accessibility Standards Canada on greater accessibility to digital tools, content, transactions and/or computer-mediated processes.

\* ICT enables users to access, store, transmit, understand, and manipulate information. \
\*\* Digital tools include online platforms and software applications.
