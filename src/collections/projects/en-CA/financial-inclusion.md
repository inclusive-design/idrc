  by addressing barriers to financial inclusion.

Many Canadians with disabilities face barriers when trying to engage in financial transactions whether its paying for goods at a store, securing a loan, or dealing with a customer service agent. Many of the same Canadians may also be vulnerable to increased financial hardships due to lack of knowledge, or because their circumstances.

The Financial Inclusion Project is working with Canadians with disabilities to better understand the barriers and vulnerabilities Canadians face when dealing with their finances, and together create approaches that address their unique needs.
