## About the Financial Inclusion Project

The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) at OCAD University is working on a project that aims to make financial systems more inclusive to people with disabilities (PWD) and Deaf people in Canada. 

### What do we mean when we say "financial systems"?

Financial systems include any systems related to money and finances. 

They include institutions like:

* Banks and credit unions
* Insurance companies
* Canada Revenue Agency

Financial systems affect your everyday interactions with money, like:

* Making payments and transferring money
* Managing your finances and planning for the future
* Managing your credit score
* Getting a loan or paying off debt
* Dealing with a tax audit
* Trying to qualify for an assistance program
* Proving you are who you say you are when you make a transaction

### What do we mean when we say "disability"?

A disability is not a medical issue or an impairment to be fixed. A disability comes up when the way something works creates a barrier for someone because of their physical, mental health, developmental, or sensory traits. These barriers prevent a person’s full and equal participation in society.

## Upcoming project events

* January 15 to 31, 2024 - Participate in a paid opportunity to share how financial systems and services can be more accessible.
* January 22, 2024 - The project is hosting an information session on January 22, 2024 1 to 2pm Eastern Time.

See "How to get involved" below for more information and how to sign up.

## Project goal

* Understand the barriers for people with disabilities and Deaf people in interacting with financial systems 
* Understand the risks for people with disabilities and Deaf people in financial systems, and the ways they may be vulnerable to fraud and financial abuse
* Learn about things that have been done in the past that make the financial systems more inclusive
* Explore promising ways to make up-and-coming financial systems more inclusive
* Share any knowledge we gain with the broader disability and Deaf communities, through both online and in-person networks.

### Outcomes

At the end of October 2024, this project expects to:
Publish a report about financial inclusion in Canada and its barriers, vulnerabilities, and approaches for people with disabilities and Deaf people.
Outline a plan for sustaining ongoing community engagement, advocacy, and education on issues related to financial inclusion.

### Mission

The mission of this project is to:

* Help the disability and Deaf communities take action to remove barriers and advocate for more inclusive financial systems
* Guide policy makers, governments, and large organizations in making more inclusive financial systems and removing current barriers
* Guide security and privacy organizations to tackle fraud, scams, and abuse faced by the disability and Deaf community

## Who we want to involve

With this project, we want to involve people who are most excluded from financial systems. This includes people with disabilities, Deaf people, and people who experience other barriers when interacting with financial systems. Participants will use their lived experience to define what financial inclusion means, and help make decisions about important topics to be included for future phases of this project.

## What we've been hearing

* Sam received a phone call from his bank that his account is frozen. He discovered that someone has his PIN and has been using it to make online purchases. He suspects that this is because he must trust his many different attendants with his PIN and card to buy groceries and essentials, as during COVID, cash is no longer accepted.  
* Lucy wishes to open an account with a pharmacy delivery service to get her medications delivered but can’t get past the CAPTCHA on the registration page because she can’t see. 
* Darren has been locked out of his account multiple times because, due to his cerebral palsy, he can’t enter the correct password in time. 
* Antonia has lost much of her life savings to a scam. She wasn’t able to detect the visual signals many people use to alert them to fraudulent claims. 
* Jose was not able to monitor his VISA card records because they didn’t work with his alternative access system, as a result there were numerous invalid charges. He can’t contest them because it requires a phone call, and he is non-speaking. 
* Rebecca is threatened with losing her disability pension because she can’t complete the financial reporting forms which are incompatible with her speech recognition system. 
* Silvia and her husband have been consistently denied loans or credit despite sufficient collateral because she has an unusual earnings history due to her episodic disability.
* Vanessa’s parents have left her investments to take care of her many essential needs since her car accident. The investment information is not in a format she can access, making it very difficult to monitor the status of the investment. She asked a neighbor to help. The neighbor made several bad choices that resulted in significant losses. 
* Ana has been audited multiple times because her tax filing is flagged due to an unusual profile caused by her episodic disability, the audits always find her in full compliance. 
* Ursula lives in a seniors housing complex. The only bank nearby is in a legacy bank building that is inaccessible to most of the residents of the complex because of the stairs. The bank has put a call bell outside to meet customers who can’t use the stairs. This doesn’t work very well for Ursula since she is losing her hearing and the traffic noise and wind makes it hard to hear outside. She has now heard that the bank is going to close the branch all together. This will leave most of her fellow residents without access to banking services. Most don’t have computers or smart phones. 
* Monica was hired by one of the five major banks to boost their diversity hiring. Because almost all of the financial applications she needed to use were inaccessible, she feels she was set up for failure. She could not perform her job, but rather than attribute it to the inaccessible tools she was given, it was attributed to her and she was let go.
* Ruth wanted to enroll her son in a financial literacy training program before he moved out to live independently. He is reliant on captioning or sign language interpretation. She could not find any financial literacy training that offered these accessibility services.
* Minesha is the owner of a small business. The budgeting, payroll and other financial tools she needs to run her business are all incompatible with the screen magnification and screen reading systems she relies on since her recent vision loss. She fears that she must close her business of more than 40 years, not because it isn’t successful but because the tools she needs exclude people with disabilities.
