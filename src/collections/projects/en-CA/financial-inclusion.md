description: Enabling Canadians with disabilities to engage fully in the economy
  by addressing barriers to financial inclusion.
---
Financial inclusion affects many Canadians, and all priority areas of the Accessible Canada Act. Accessibility obstacles in financial systems, services and institutions prevent equitable participation in the Canadian economy. The future of money, financial transactions & financial decision tools in Canada are at a decisive moment of transition. The disability community must participate in the design decisions that will have a pervasive impact, felt most acutely by people at the margins.

The Financial Inclusion Project is working with organizations of persons with disabilities, and the Canadian disability community to better understand the barriers and vulnerabilities Canadians face when dealing with their finances, and together create approaches that address their unique needs. The knowledge gathered will be shared broadly with communities, stakeholders, and the sector.

Details about upcoming co-design events planned for early 2024 will be shared soon.
