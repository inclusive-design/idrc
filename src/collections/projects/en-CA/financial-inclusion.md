## About the Financial Inclusion Project

The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) at OCAD University is working on a project that aims to make financial systems more inclusive to people with disabilities (PWD) and Deaf people in Canada. 

### What do we mean when we say "financial systems"?

Financial systems include any systems related to money and finances. 

They include institutions like:

* Banks and credit unions
* Insurance companies
* Canada Revenue Agency

Financial systems affect your everyday interactions with money, like:

* Making payments and transferring money
* Managing your finances and planning for the future
* Managing your credit score
* Getting a loan or paying off debt
* Dealing with a tax audit
* Trying to qualify for an assistance program
* Proving you are who you say you are when you make a transaction

### What do we mean when we say "disability"?

A disability is not a medical issue or an impairment to be fixed. A disability comes up when the way something works creates a barrier for someone because of their physical, mental health, developmental, or sensory traits. These barriers prevent a person’s full and equal participation in society.

## Upcoming project events

* January 15, 2024 - The project is hosting an information session on January 15, 2024 1 to 2pm Eastern Time.
* January 19 to 23, 2024 - Participate in a paid survey about financial inclusion.

See "How to get involved" below for more information and how to sign up.

## Project goal

* Understand the barriers for people with disabilities and Deaf people in interacting with financial systems 
* Understand the risks for people with disabilities and Deaf people in financial systems, and the ways they may be vulnerable to fraud and financial abuse
* Learn about things that have been done in the past that make the financial systems more inclusive
* Explore promising ways to make up-and-coming financial systems more inclusive
* Share any knowledge we gain with the broader disability and Deaf communities, through both online and in-person networks.

### Outcomes

At the end of October 2024, this project expects to:
Publish a report about financial inclusion in Canada and its barriers, vulnerabilities, and approaches for people with disabilities and Deaf people.
Outline a plan for sustaining ongoing community engagement, advocacy, and education on issues related to financial inclusion.

### Mission

The mission of this project is to:

* Help the disability and Deaf communities take action to remove barriers and advocate for more inclusive financial systems
* Guide policy makers, governments, and large organizations in making more inclusive financial systems and removing current barriers
* Guide security and privacy organizations to tackle fraud, scams, and abuse faced by the disability and Deaf community

## Who we want to involve

With this project, we want to involve people who are most excluded from financial systems. This includes people with disabilities, Deaf people, and people who experience other barriers when interacting with financial systems. Participants will use their lived experience to define what financial inclusion means, and help make decisions about important topics to be included for future phases of this project.
