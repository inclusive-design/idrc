## About the project

Review of the Review (RotR) is assisting Accessibility Standards Canada in developing standards development processes and activities that are accessible and inclusively designed. 

The goal of the project is to review the approach to standards development from the preliminary stages through to public review and provide advice, guidance, and recommendations to improve inclusion and accessibility as well as foster co-development of the standards with communities most impacted by them.
