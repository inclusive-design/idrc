  An international community of open source developers, designers, researchers,
  educators and co-designers who work together to **proactively ensure that
  emerging technology and practices are designed inclusively**.

  the [Inclusive Design Institute](https://inclusivedesign.ca/). Both were
  founded by Dr. Jutta Treviranus with the help of her team and community.
