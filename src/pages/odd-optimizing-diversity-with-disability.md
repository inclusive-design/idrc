    title: About
    content: IDRC with the support of Kessler Foundation and Microsoft has launched
      ODD (Optimizing Diversity with Disability). The goal of ODD is to
      investigate bias in hiring algorithms using non-disability specific and
      synthesized disability specific employment data. In the next year, we will
      work with the community to create synthetic models of resume and job
      seeker data that will be tested with online hiring systems. The goal is to
      better understand how to mitigate algorithmic bias and use this knowledge
      in future projects to develop algorithms that can optimize diversity.
