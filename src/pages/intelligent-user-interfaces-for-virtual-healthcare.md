## Objective
Reduce barriers to virtual healthcare

## About the Intelligent User Interfaces for Virtual Healthcare Project?
During the pandemic response and recovery, many health units are moving to virtual care. With this transition there is a risk that vulnerable individuals and communities will be excluded which harms and poses risks for the excluded individuals. Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) and the National Research Council (NRC) under the [Pandemic Response Challenge Program](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/programs/pandemic-response-challenge-program) collaborated to: 
1. create guidelines for virtual healthcare systems that are inclusive and address the diversity of human needs, including cognitive, age-related and cultural barriers.  
2. develop an architecture plan for an openly licensed software platform that enables interaction and interface personalization to meet currently unmet needs faced by individuals when engaging in virtual healthcare. 

## Outcomes
[Guide for Reducing Barriers to Virtual Healthcare (Guide)](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/IUIGFVP/Guide+for+Reducing+Barriers+to+Virtual+Healthcare) â€“an initial guide that is the result of working with collaborators living in Canada who have personal experiences with the healthcare system, and healthcare professionals with knowledge from their areas of practice.

[Software Approach for Expressing Personal Preferences for Healthcare (Approach)](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/IUIGFVP/Section+-+Software+Approaches+for+Expressing+Personal+Preferences+for+Healthcare) which outlines a software architecture that can be used to address inclusion gaps in virtual healthcare settings.

### About the _Guide_
The _Guide_ is organized in five sections related to healthcare:

1. Recipients (patients, clients, etc.)
2. Providers (practitioners, clinician, etc.)
3. Technology
4. Systems
5. Empowerment

Each section consists of guidelines covering many scenarios that can help identify areas to improve inclusion and accessibility.

## About the Software Approach 
The _Software Approach for Expressing Personal Preferences for Healthcare_ outlines a method for reducing barriers using a system that gathers, stores, and applies personal preferences. Implementing this approach can address issues identified by the Guide.

The _Approach_ does not prescribe a particular technology, rather it leaves those choices open so system builders. Service providers can customize and configure based on the needs of their infrastructure (i.e. security and privacy needs) and the needs of the stakeholders like patients, caregivers, and practitioners.
