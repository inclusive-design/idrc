    title: Ways to begin
    content: There will never be just one way to do the work of inclusion or
      inclusive design. Rather than a framework or an ideology, inclusive design
      is a perspective shift that requires unlearning, questioning, and
      reimagining. Inclusive Design is the horizontal thread that stretches
      throughout  the vertical functions/pillars of organizations. This work
      stretches from very tactical, technical know-how to having a mature
      emotional intelligence to discern the context, the stakeholders, the
      needs, and the complex relational aspects of everything. Our mix of
      services can help you meet your inclusion goals.

      We offer accessibility reviews, audits, and consulting at every stage of
      the design process. Grounded in our expertise in inclusion and the Web
      Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we review designs, websites,
      mobile apps, and other digital interactions and provide you with the
      guidance you need to create accessible experiences. You don’t need wait
      until you've built something to review it. Whether you have napkin
      sketches, wireframes, functional prototypes, design systems, or anything
      in between, we can help you identify potential accessibility barriers
      early and provide specific guidance on how to implement designs and
      interactions in the most accessible way possible.


      * WCAG audits

      * Design reviews (wireframes, prototypes, design systems, style guides, surveys, etc.)

      * Accessibility annotation

      * Accessibility plans
