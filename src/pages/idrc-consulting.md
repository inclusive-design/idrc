        Website accessibility evaluations are available for web sites (including web applications and mobile web apps) to check conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.


        Conforming to WCAG 2.0 is key to ensuring usability by diverse users and for meeting the various legislative requirements that are emerging around the world:

        - Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

        - Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act (Section 508)

        - Australia's Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)

        - and many others.
