        ### Consulting

        The best time to get accessibility advice on your project is right from the start! But whether you are at the wireframe stage, have a site in development, or are implementing the changes recommended by an audit, we can guide you in creating an accessible website at any time in your design and development process.

        ### Training

        #### Website accessibility

        Group training is available for both technical and non-technical audiences. Training sessions cover:

        - How people with disabilities use the Web.

        - The inclusive business case.

        - A detailed overview of how to meet WCAG 2.0.

        - How to perform your own accessibility evaluations.

        - Authoring tool support for WCAG 2.0.

        #### Office document accessibility

        Group training is also available on creating accessible office documents (Word, PDF) with Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat. This non-technical training is a companion to the free Accessible Digital Office Document (ADOD) resource that the IDRC maintains.

        ### Audits

        Website accessibility evaluations are available for web sites (including web applications and mobile web apps) to check conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

        Conforming to WCAG 2.0 is key to ensuring usability by diverse users and for meeting the various legislative requirements that are emerging around the world:

        - Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

        - Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act (Section 508)

        - Australia's Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)

        - and many others.
