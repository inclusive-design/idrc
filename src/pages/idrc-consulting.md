      ## Consulting


      We strongly believe in **one-size-fits-one** solutions, and this extends to our services. We work closely with our clients to meet you where you are and co-create customized approaches that can include a combination of training, accessibility evaluation, and flexible consulting support. There is no fixed, linear path through this work; organizations that feel behind can make great leaps through sustainable initiatives. Our consulting ethos is that everyone can (and should) learn to fold the perspective shift that Inclusive Design gives us into everything we do professionally: product-related, team-related, procurement, HR, management, hiring, external outreach… everything.


      ### ***We want to help you achieve your inclusion and accessibility goals.***


      ## Training


      Inclusion and accessibility are a team effort combining skills from ideation to practical skills (the tactical) and to culture. We offer a wide range of training approaches and workshops to take your team to the next level, whether you’re looking to change minds, learn practical skills, or inspire teams.


      Along with training workshops, we can provide experiential and hands-on learning activities such as inclusive design sprints and inclusive design challenges. When creating or customizing content, IDRC can co-create with the client (to their desired level of engagement) what those trainings will be. You can build custom training from our list of topics or start with a prepared workshop that bundles related topics.


      Training may include but is not limited to the following topics:


      **Inclusive Design Thinking (Introduction and Applied)**


      * What is accessibility? What is inclusion? How are they related to innovation?

      * Definitions of equity, inclusion, and diversity (DEI, EDI, BEDI, etc.) demystified.

      * Developing an inclusive culture; building capacity.

      * Innovation, change and the perspective shift that is inclusive thinking.


      **Accessibility: How To**


      * Understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG

      * Accessible design patterns and annotation

      * Approaches to UI/Web accessibility evaluation

      * Accessible Graphic Design

      * Physical Space Accessibility


      ### ***Build custom training from our list of topics or start with a prepared workshop that bundles related topics.***


      ## Digital Accessibility reviews


      We offer accessibility reviews and audits at every stage of the design process. Grounded in our expertise in accessibility and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we test websites, mobile apps, and other digital interactions and provide you with the guidance you need to create accessible experiences. We will review designs, existing websites, apps, VPATs or other accessibility communication.


      ### ***We will do accessibility reviews and audits at every stage of the design process.***
