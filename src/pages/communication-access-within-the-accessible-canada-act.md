IDRC and Communication Disability Access Canada is working together to address communication access for people who have speech, language and communication disabilities. This project will focus on communication access for people who have speech, language and communication disabilities due to life-long or acquired cognitive and/or neurological disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, Down Syndrome, learning disability, intellectual disability, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, aphasia after a stroke, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinsonâ€™s disease, or multiple sclerosis. 

## About Communication

* Communication is an interactive, two-way process that includes both understanding and being understood. It involves a range of communication methods in face-to-face interactions, over the telephone and remote communications, online and via reading and writing.
* Communication methods include speech, gestures, body language, writing, drawing, pictures, symbol and letter boards, speech-generating devices, as well as human services such as sign language interpreting, captioning in real time, informal and formal communication assistance. 

## Planned Reports

1. Framing report: Define the disability populations and personal communication supports for Canadians requiring access to federal services 
2. Scoping report: Define the scope of accessibility barriers, and accommodations that people with communication disabilities may require to access different federal services. 
3. Research report: Project findings and our recommended guidelines and standards.
