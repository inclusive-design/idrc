IDRC is working to address communication access for people who have speech, language, and communication disabilities. With advice from an advisory panel and Communication Disabilities Access Canada, this project will focus on communication access for people who have speech, language and communication disabilities due to life-long or acquired cognitive and/or neurological disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, Down Syndrome, learning disability, intellectual disability, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, aphasia after a stroke, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, or multiple sclerosis. 

## About Communication

* Communication is an interactive, two-way process that includes both understanding and being understood. It involves a range of communication methods in face-to-face interactions, over the telephone and remote communications, online and via reading and writing.
* Communication methods include speech, gestures, body language, writing, drawing, pictures, symbol and letter boards, speech-generating devices, as well as human services such as sign language interpreting, captioning in real time, informal and formal communication assistance.
