Software developer, former public librarian. I've worked at the IDRC since 2015, primarily on projects related to inclusive and open education and educational technology, and on the management and evolution of our infrastructure and operations. I am particularly interested in inclusive design's intersection with the technologies and methodologies of modern software development, and in the practicalities of trying to create more inclusive patterns in building software and systems.
