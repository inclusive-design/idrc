**The Inclusive Design Research Centre started in 1993 as the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University of Toronto.**

The ATRC was an international centre of expertise in the inclusive design of emerging information, communication systems and practices. One of the ATRCâ€™s main research focuses was the Web, and the ATRC grew up with the Web.

**As of August 1, 2010, the ATRC moved to OCAD University in Toronto and was renamed the Inclusive Design Research Centre.**

The mission of the IDRC continues to be the inclusive design of emerging information and communication systems and practices.
