### A Message from Our Director

Friends and colleagues,

What is intelligence? The Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition is: “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations. Also: the skilled use of reason.” What we consider to be human intelligence appears to have created a swarm of trying situations that we do not know how to deal with. Is it time to reconsider what we mean by intelligence? We have had one expansion of intelligence when we admitted that there might be another dimension to intelligence, namely emotional intelligence. The Psychology Today definition is: “Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.”

Neither of these dimensions of intelligence appears to have considered the broader or long-term consequences of our decisions. Our reasoning has been short-ranged and over-simplistic. Our strategizing has been enamored of reducing considerations to numbers and complex factors into cleanly boxed categories, ignoring the entangled connections and relationships.

Our intelligence, even when expanded to include emotional intelligence, appears to be bereft of a global view and an ethical compass. We seem not to be cognizant of the simple fact that we are all connected and living on a single planet. That what goes around, comes around. We can’t recognize the importance of maintaining our diversity or learning to navigate complexity. Because we have created artificial intelligence in our image, it has only amplified, accelerated, and automated our deficient form of intelligence. It has become a power tool that speeds us to further trying situations. At Project We Count we hope to do a small part to create a more complete, long-term, broader definition of human and machine intelligence.

All my best,

Jutta 

### News from the Field

Gathering Strength, Gathering Storms: The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) 2021 Study Panel Report
The 2021 AI100 report is out! Learn more about the current state of AI, its impacts and where the technology is moving in this report written by multidisciplinary researchers in the field. 

Toyota Pauses Paralympics Self-Driving Buses after One Hits Visually Impaired Athlete
During the Paralympics in Tokyo, as this Guardian article reveals, Toyota paused their self-driving shuttle service after an athlete who has a vision disability was struck by one of their self-driving buses. Like the pedestrian who was killed by a self-driving car in 2018, this athlete did not fit the "standard" pedestrian model, which suggests that self-driving AI systems may not yet be built for diversity or be able to work with outlier data.  

Now That Machines Can Learn, Can They Unlearn?
With increased privacy concerns about AI systems, as this WIRED article explains, researchers are testing whether sensitive data can be removed from those systems without completely retraining them.

Want to learn more about machine and deep learning? Check out the ML Compendium, a highly detailed resource with over 500 ML-related topics, and participate in expanding the resource and making it more accessible. 

How AI Can Help Shatter Barriers to Equality
In this TED Talk, Jamila Gordon shows how AI is helping refugees, migrants and those from disadvantaged backgrounds find jobs and develop the skills they need to work effectively and safely. 

Foundation Models Risk Exacerbating ML’s Ethical Challenges
Learn about the far-reaching consequences of foundation models in this VentureBeat article. 

How Bad Data Keeps Us from Good AI
Mainak Mazumdar shows in this TED Talk how less-than-quality data leads to AI that makes wrong decisions and predictions, and he reveals three infrastructural resets needed to make ethical AI possible. 

Why Some Cities Are Banning Facial Recognition Technology

The Race to Build AI That Benefits Humanity with Sam Altman
In this TED Interview, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman makes a case for AI's potential to make the future better for all of us. 

Watch Abhishek Gupta's (MAIEI) talk about how a disconnect between the theoretical advances in solving AI ethics challenges and their practical implementation has led to a stasis in AI ethics. 

### This Month

In preparation for our Minorities and Outlier Data co-design, we’re encouraging everyone to think about the challenge of proof for a small group, even a group that is just one person: you.

Think of something you experience in your life that is difficult to demonstrate. Perhaps it’s an emotion you feel, a value you hold or a pain you experience. How might you go about proving your experience to someone else? How might you document or demonstrate it? What kind of proof could you produce to convince someone about the validity of your experience?

Share your ideas of how to approach this challenge with the We Count community by leaving a comment on the We Count website. 

### Graduate Research Assistant Positions

The IDRC is hiring three research assistants to integrate with the Equitable Digital Systems (EDS) team and support their work with identifying gaps in currently available standards that address the accessibility of digital tools, systems and associated practices deployed by organizations regulated by Bill C-81, the Accessible Canada Act.

The EDS team is developing a research knowledge base of current and emerging technical systems that present barriers to employees and prospective employees with disabilities. The team is co-creating an open platform that collects community research, new knowledge and input regarding emerging technical systems from a disability and accessibility perspective.
