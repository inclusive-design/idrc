projectName: Learning to Be Human Together
title: Learning to Be Human Together
shortName: Humanizing Learning
description: "This resource explores the importance of, and processes for,
  humanizing education. We start by exploring what humanizing teaching and
  learning means: to acknowledge that our relationships are foundational to the
  work that we do. It aims to make learning inclusive with connection, access,
  and meaning-making at its core."

This resource also includes an exploration of the co-design experience – the process of creating and nurturing a community that collectively did this work. Coming out the other side of this work are a group of people who came together to share our love for learning and our passion for education. We hope you find something here that changes even one small aspect of how you move through the world.
