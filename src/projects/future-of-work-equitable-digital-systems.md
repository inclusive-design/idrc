The *Future of Work: Equitable Digital Systems* project was an initiative at the Inclusive Design Research Centre, OCAD University examining the accessibility of the digital tools and systems we rely upon for work. The focus of the project was to ensure that current and emerging technology and digital systems and their associated practices are meeting the needs of and enabling work for persons with disabilities. The project looked specifically at systems used by organizations that are regulated by the Accessible Canada Act, Bill C-81.

The voice and perspective of the disability community was a central focus of the project and along with ten disability research and advocacy organizations, 55 individuals with lived experience of disability contributed to the project over 12 co-design research sessions. Co-designs enhanced our understanding of barriers within digital systems by placing those systems and the experiences of people with disabilities who use or are impacted by them within the full context of people’s lives—their lived experiences and the intersections of technology, work, and life.

Throughout the *Equitable Digital Systems* project, people with disabilities led the direction and outcomes of research: to carve a path towards equitable and inclusive digital systems.
