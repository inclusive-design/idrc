projectName: "Future of Work: Equitable Digital Systems (EDS)"
title: "A Description of the Project: EDS"
shortName: EDS
description: Equitable Digital Systems focused on examining the accessibility of
  the digital tools and systems we use for work. We used our shared experiences
  to make recommendations for Accessibility Standards Canada on how to prevent
  accessibility barriers at work from information and communication systems.

The *Future of Work: Equitable Digital Systems* project was an initiative at the Inclusive Design Research Centre, OCAD University examining the accessibility of the digital tools and systems we rely upon for work. The focus of the project was to ensure that current and emerging technology and digital systems and their associated practices are meeting the needs of and enabling work for persons with disabilities. The project looked specifically at systems used by organizations that are regulated by the Accessible Canada Act, Bill C-81.

The voice and perspective of the disability community was a central focus of the project and along with ten disability research and advocacy organizations, 55 individuals with lived experience of disability contributed to the project over 12 co-design research sessions. Co-designs enhanced our understanding of barriers within digital systems by placing those systems and the experiences of people with disabilities who use or are impacted by them within the full context of people’s lives—their lived experiences and the intersections of technology, work, and life.

Throughout the *Equitable Digital Systems* project, people with disabilities led the direction and outcomes of research: to carve a path towards equitable and inclusive digital systems.

### Co-design

We conducted 4 co-design sets (each consisting of 3 sessions) where we explored, using different approaches, how technologies present barriers, how our technologies could meet the needs of people with disabilities, and how people with disabilities are compelled to \*compromise\* expectations for an often inequitable experience.

#### Storytelling

One of the co-design sets brought contributors together where we all created "Stories from The Imaginary." The storytelling technique allowed us to describe our experiences in a fictionalized (but deeply informed) situation where people with disabilities interact with technologies in the context of work. The stories can be viewed:

#### Letters

For another co-design set, teams of co-designers wrote letters to technology. The intention was to capture a day-to-day technology function and redesign that through reimagining. Co-designers created three letters about technologies they regularly use or know well, which may be used in a workplace or as part of a job. The first letter is a love letter. The second letter is a break-up letter. The third letter is a 'compromise' letter.
