title: "Future of Work: Equitable Digital Systems"
shortName: EDS
description: Equitable Digital Systems focused on examining the accessibility of
  the digital tools and systems we use for work. We used our shared experiences
  to make recommendations for Accessibility Standards Canada on how to prevent
  accessibility barriers at work from information and communication systems.

The *Future of Work: Equitable Digital Systems* project was an initiative at the Inclusive Design Research Centre, OCAD U examining the accessibility of the digital tools and systems we rely upon for work. The focus of the project was on ensuring that current and emerging technology and digital systems and their associated practices are meeting the needs of and enabling work for persons with disabilities. The project looked specifically at systems used by organizations that are regulated by the Accessible Canada Act, Bill C-81.

One of the primary goals of the *Equitable Digital Systems* project was to create a catalogue of the digital systems in use by organizations under Bill C-81. The purpose of cataloguing these digital systems was to develop a comprehensive overview of the tools being used in workplaces, so accessibility barriers can be better understood and addressed. The project used a comparative approach by using the international policy landscape to analyze local accessibility standards, regulations, and guidelines for digital systems. This analysis of international policies helped identify the current gaps in Canadian regulations and will inform local stakeholders about the areas where both policy and practice can improve. This analysis identified where Canadian policy can lead international policy. In the process, we sought to capitalize on opportunities for inclusive design as we analyzed the best strategies for the ethical integration of digital systems in the workplace.

To fill the regulatory gaps that we found in our research, we hosted co-design sessions with our partner organizations and people with disabilities. The insights and recommendations we received from our co-design sessions will help us prevent new accessibility barriers in emerging digital systems. Our participatory approach ensures that our research was community-driven and represented the voices of the people most impacted by these technologies.

We developed an accessible, open online resource site where our research is stored. This online resource has been designed to provide people with disabilities with up-to-date and accurate information about emerging technology as it relates to disability and employment. It serves as a repository to help people with disabilities understand the specific risks and opportunities of these technologies.

Throughout the *Equitable Digital Systems* project, people with disabilities led the direction and outcomes of research. This is how we carve a path towards equitable and inclusive digital systems.
