title: Accessibility in Action
description: >-
  Accessibility in Action sets out to create an online platform that will bring
  disability communities together with the thousands of organizations regulated
  under the [Accessible Canada Act of
  2019](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada.html).
  The initiative aims to facilitate effective engagement of people with
  disabilities and federally-regulated entities in creating an accessible and
  inclusive Canada that fully respects and protects the human rights of people
  with disabilities.
